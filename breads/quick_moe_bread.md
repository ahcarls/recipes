Quick (ish) Bread Recipe

http://moemartinez.com/m-bread-recipe/

Ingredients
* (1.125 lbs/18 oz) of white unbleached flour
* 2 tsp ok Kosher Salt
* 2 Cups of warm water
* 1 tbsp of sugar ( you can substitute honey but the taste is slightly different, give it a try)
* 2 tsp of Active-Dry Yeast
* cooking spray or butter

Directions

Take the water and dissolve the sugar in it and then put the yeast in (warm tap water is fine, but not to hot or you will kill the yeast. If you can put your finger in and not be uncomfortable then its fine). Let this sit for about 10 minutes until the yeast froths (a little longer is fine just as long as the yeast is frothy).

Mix the flour and salt in a mixing bowl (I usually whisk them together) and when the water/yeast is ready pour it into the flour and mix together with a wooden spoon or spatula.

This dough will be really sticky and thats OK just make sure all the flour and water are mixed in.

Cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for two hours, at which point your dough will have risen to about double.

Preheat oven the 425째 F. I usually turn on oven around the one hour mark of the first rise so that the oven is ready to go when we are done.

After the dough has risen, take your spoon/spatula and scrape it against the side of the bowl and bring the edge of the dough to the middle and keep folding like this all around the bowl.

Spray the inside of a bread pan with oil and put bread dough in pan. Let sit for 30 minutes until its risen a bit.

Bake Bread for 15 minutes at 425째F, lower oven temperature to 375째 and bake for another 15 minutes. bread internal temp is done at 190째

Pull bread out of oven and turn out onto a rack to cool. ( let it cool some first; I know this is hard trust me!)
